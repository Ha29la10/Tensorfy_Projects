# **Vehicle Fuel Consumption Analysis and Prediction**

## **Project Description**

This project aims to investigate how various vehicle attributes influence city-cycle fuel consumption using machine learning techniques. The goal is to effectively segment vehicles based on their characteristics and develop models to predict fuel consumption, specifically miles per gallon (mpg).

## **Overview**

Understanding fuel consumption is crucial for the automotive industry to design efficient vehicles and reduce environmental impacts. This project utilizes both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to analyze vehicle data:

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering techniques are employed to segment cars into different groups based on their attributes.
- **Supervised Learning**: Predictive models are developed using the `mpg` attribute as the target variable to forecast the fuel efficiency of vehicles.

## **Objectives**

1. **Cluster Analysis**:
   - Use unsupervised machine learning techniques (e.g., K-Means) to group cars based on their attributes.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand the different segments within the vehicle market.

2. **Fuel Consumption Prediction**:
   - Apply supervised machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression) with `mpg` (miles per gallon) as the target label.
   - Evaluate and optimize models to accurately predict the fuel consumption of cars based on their attributes.

## **Observations**

- **Manufacturing Years**: Cars in the dataset range from 1970 to 1982, with the highest number of cars manufactured in 1973.
- **Cylinders**: The number of cylinders varies between 3 to 8, with the majority of the cars having 4 cylinders.
- **Origin**: The "Origin" attribute has values of 1, 2, and 3, with most cars having an Origin value of 1.
- **Weight vs. Engine Specifications**:
  - The number of cylinders and displacement values increase with the weight of the car.
  - Heavier cars require more power, leading to a higher number of cylinders and greater displacement.
- **Weight vs. Fuel Efficiency**:
  - There is an inverse relationship between car weight and mpg; as weight increases, fuel efficiency decreases.
  - Heavier cars consume more fuel due to the increased power needed, resulting in higher fuel consumption and lower mpg.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collect vehicle data with various attributes such as engine size, weight, horsepower, and others.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's ready for clustering and modeling.

2. **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**:
   - Apply clustering techniques to segment cars based on their features.
   - Visualize and interpret the clusters to understand how different vehicle types influence fuel consumption.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Engineer new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
   - Normalize and scale data as needed for both clustering and predictive modeling.

4. **Model Development (Supervised Learning)**:
   - Train multiple regression models to predict `mpg` using vehicle attributes.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize the models.

5. **Evaluation and Interpretation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Interpret the results to provide actionable insights into factors that significantly impact fuel consumption.

6. **Reporting**:
   - Document findings, including clustering results and predictive model performance.
   - Provide recommendations based on the analysis for vehicle design or policy considerations.

## 
## **Results and Insights**

- Successfully segmented vehicles into distinct clusters based on their attributes.
- Developed robust models that accurately predict fuel consumption, helping manufacturers understand which features contribute most to fuel efficiency.

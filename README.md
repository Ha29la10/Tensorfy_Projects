#  **FIFA Data Analysis Project**
##  Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a FIFA dataset, applying various data science techniques to extract meaningful insights about the players. The primary goal is to answer key questions related to player performance, demographics, and distribution across different clubs and positions.

###  Steps Involved
**Reading the Data:**
Loaded the FIFA dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

**Basic Exploration:**
-Inspected the dataset structure, including checking the number of rows, columns, and data types.
 
**Univariate Analysis:**
-Conducted single-variable analysis to understand the distribution of individual features.
-Visualized key statistics such as age, overall rating, and market value.

**Multivariate Analysis:**
-Explored relationships between multiple variables.
-Analyzed correlations between features like overall rating, potential, and age.

**Handling Null & Duplicated Values:**
-Identified and addressed missing data using appropriate strategies (e.g., filling or dropping).
-Removed duplicated entries to ensure data quality.

**Dealing with Outliers:**
-Detected and managed outliers to prevent skewed analysis results.
-Applied methods such as  IQR to treat outliers.
**One-Hot Encoding and Feature Scaling:**
-Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features for model compatibility.
-Scaled numerical features to standardize the data for better model performance.

**Splitting the Data:**
-Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for model development.

###  **Key Questions Answered**

**Age Distribution in Famous Clubs:**
-Analyzed and visualized the age distribution of players in well-known football clubs.
-Provided insights into the average age and experience level of players in top teams.
**Overall Rating in Famous Clubs:**
-Examined the overall ratings of players in popular clubs.
-Compared the distribution of ratings across different teams.
**Who are the 10 Best Players?**
-Identified the top 10 players based on overall ratings.
 **Visualizing Number of Players at Different Positions:**
-Created visualizations to show the distribution of players across various positions (e.g., forward, midfield, defense).
-Highlighted which positions are most densely populated.
**How Can We Visualize the Overall Score of the Players?**
-Developed visualizations (e.g., bar plots, histograms) to represent the overall scores of players.
-Provided insights into the performance levels of players across the dataset.

###  **Tools and Libraries Used**
1-Pandas for data manipulation and exploration

2-Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization

3-Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and splitting

4-NumPy for numerical computations
### **Conclusion**
-This project provided a comprehensive analysis of FIFA players, offering insights into player demographics, performance, and distribution across various attributes. 
-The findings can be used to understand trends in football player characteristics and inform decision-making for team management and player scouting.
